Hey, I am
# João Victor 👋🏽

 I'm a developer passionate about building web apps. I have developed with some languages, such as C, C++, Java, PHP and others. But I went deep with React and NodeJS.\
 Here is some techs that I'm working on my projects:
### 👨🏽‍💻 Javascript & Typescript
### 🧐 NodeJS
### ⚛ React
### 🔳 Redux
### 💅🏻 Styled Components
### ☁ Databases

 I am always ready to learn new things that may be needed for new projects. \
 And last but no least, check my pinned projects, there is some cool things there 🙋🏽‍♂️.
